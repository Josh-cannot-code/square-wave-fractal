# square-wave-fractal
This was a project I did before I had formal training in python. 
The code is a bit of a mess but gives quite a cool graph which
I believe to be an accurate model of the square wave fractal produced
and sold by Kinetrika. 

I highly reccomend downloading the code and running it as a jupyer 
notebook so that the model can be rotated as the stationary version 
does not do it justice.

I hope that when I get a break from my studies I will be able to re-code
this in a way that makes sense and is readable.
Thanks for checking it out!!!
