# square-wave-fractal
This was a project I did before I had formal training in python. 
The code is a bit of a mess but gives quite a cool graph which
I believe to be an accurate model of the square wave fractal produced
and sold by Kinetrika. 

I highly reccomend downloading the code and running it as a jupyer 
notebook so that the model can be rotated as the stationary version 
does not do it justice.

When the function is called, the first argument controls the number of
splines in the model and the second argument controls their angle of 
deflection with respect to their neighbors. I reccomend angles between
pi/24 and pi/6.

I hope that when I get a break from my studies I will be able to re-code
this in a way that makes sense and is readable.
Thanks for checking it out!!!
